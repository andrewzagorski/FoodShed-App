    The UW Campus Food Shed is a new student organization (as of spring 2018),
    designed by former undergraduate student Hannah DePorter in 2017. Funded by
    a grant from the Kemper Knapp Bequest written by Irwin Goldman and Hannah,
    the Campus Food Shed is designed to collect fresh research produce, as well
    as other produce that would otherwise be thrown away, and make it free to
    all UW Madison students, staff, and faculty. Two active refrigerators
    holding this produce are located in the Plant Science building (second
    floor, near loading dock) and Student Activities Center at 333 East Campus
    Mall (3rd floor). The refrigerators will be available during normal building
    hours for these locations. Produce will be available seasonally, and as
    resources provide. Availability subject to change.
